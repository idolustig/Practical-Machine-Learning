#Quantified Self Movement Data Analysis  
A Coursera Practical Machine Learning project by Ido Lustig  

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal 
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts 
who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they 
are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify 
how well they do it.  

This analysts is aimed at using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants for predicting 
how (well) the exercise was done.
